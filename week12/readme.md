Laab Book
This week we continued to learn Panda and Matplotlib.
We initially started trying to make forms.
And look up the information on the website which is given by the teacher.
I try to make my research more thorough.
It's coming to the lecture day. 
I don't think I'm ready yet.
I'm going to keep working on this speech.
