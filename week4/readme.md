#Lab Book
I learn a lot of things this week
I think this week to learn the knowledge is much more difficult than the first few weeks to learn knowledge
This week I learned how to rewrite a website
In the process of practice, I several times more than the number of visits a web site
This week's homework is difficult, but I like to accept the challenge
